## Introduction 
When we are preparing for language test, we often require using a lot of flashcards to memorize vocabulary. But as time goes by, the accumulated flashcards will be hard to organize and it becomes easier to mistakenly repeat recording the same word. Therefore, I created a prototype flash card web app for JLPT to provide a cleaner and organized way to memorize new vocabulary.
## System Architecture 
I use cloud firestore as backend, nodejs and express  for server, and use Vue as frontend
